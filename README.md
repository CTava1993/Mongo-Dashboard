# Mongo-Dashboard

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This README file will specifically be used to address the prompts of my final assignment in this course, below.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

~How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To start, I could use this CRUD python module later on down the line for any work I would potentially do regarding Mongo and Dash framework. If not for these things specifically, then it works as an excellent reference tool for other projects that would be similar. As for writing maintainable, readable and adaptable code? That just comes down to Object Orientation Principles. Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, etc. I generally try to keep my code organized and spaced out so it's easy to read and see where things are. Beyond that, it's following the previously mentioned principles to keep my functions future proofed as much as possible.


~How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I find myself approaching problems as a computer scientist in all facets of my life, even if it isn't a programming problem. I am a great top-down problem solver, so I tackle things in that same approach. Find the core problem that is assessed and define it, separate everything into as small of a piece as you can in order to isolate the problem, then plan an approach that makes logical sense to meet the request. If I'm honest, my approach to this course didn't differ much at all from other courses and previous problems, however feedback during testing was often difficult when using Mongo, so I had to just run with what I had a lot.

~What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A computer scientist basically does exactly what I discussed in the previous 2 questions. Through forward thinking, future proofing and clever problem solving, computer scientists are able to find solutions to many every day problems. Sometimes in a far more... unorthodox way, depending on how much of an out-of-the-box thinker you might be.
